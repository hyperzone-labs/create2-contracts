# Create2 Contract

## Usage

### Pre Requisites

Before being able to run any command, you need to create a `.env` file and set a BIP-39 compatible mnemonic as an
environment variable. You can follow the example in `.env.example`. If you don't already have a mnemonic, you can use
this [website](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/) to generate one.

Then, proceed with installing dependencies:

```sh
$ pnpm install
```

### Compile

Compile the smart contracts with Hardhat:

```sh
$ pnpm compile
```

### TypeChain

Compile the smart contracts and generate TypeChain bindings:

```sh
$ pnpm typechain
```

### Test

Run the tests with Hardhat:

```sh
$ pnpm test
```

### Lint Solidity

Lint the Solidity code:

```sh
$ pnpm lint:sol
```

### Lint TypeScript

Lint the TypeScript code:

```sh
$ pnpm lint:ts
```

### Coverage

Generate the code coverage report:

```sh
$ pnpm coverage
```

### Report Gas

See the gas usage per unit test and average gas per method call:

```sh
$ REPORT_GAS=true pnpm test
```

### Clean

Delete the smart contract artifacts, the coverage reports and the Hardhat cache:

```sh
$ pnpm clean
```

### Deploy

Deploy the contracts to Hardhat Network:

```sh
$ pnpm deploy --greeting "Bonjour, le monde!"
```

## Tips

### Syntax Highlighting

If you use VSCode, you can get Solidity syntax highlighting with the
[hardhat-solidity](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) extension.
